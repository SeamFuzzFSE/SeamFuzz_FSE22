This directory is to provide the raw data generated by each fuzzer we used in our paper (AFL++, AFL++ with mopt, SeamFuzz)

Since each raw data is too large, we additionally provide [a google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AiH62E5EB5hma2ynGOivF8KXSmha9q_5?usp=sharing) for download
