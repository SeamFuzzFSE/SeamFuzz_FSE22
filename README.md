# SeamFuzz_FSE22
FSE22 SeamFuzz submission

We implemented SeamFuzz on top of AFL++.


## FSE_fuzzbench_raw_data

This directory includes the result logging files provided by FuzzBench for experiments in our submitted paper. 
Using the data files and the script file provided by RuzzBench, anyone can generate the experimental result table and the features. 

## FSE_fuzzers_raw_data

This directory is to provide the raw data which includes test-cases and a logging file generated by each fuzzer we used for our experiment.
  Since the files are too large, we additionally provide [a google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AiH62E5EB5hma2ynGOivF8KXSmha9q_5?usp=sharing) for download.
  
## SeamFuzz

This is a directory to include all src files of AFL++ with our approch SeamFuzz.
The installataion and usage is the same as AFL++ except that the specific option is required to run SeamFuzz.


The description will be updated.
